Installation tips:
1.The class ConnectionsHandler has a boolean "isTest". When the boolean is true, the application will ignore to check if the wifi is correct. When false the program will work as intended.

2. You will need an android phone to test the app since normal emulators don't support wifimanagers.

If you're running gitinspector and checking authors. Alexander Kloutschek = Rektorn.


The concept of this project was created during the Concept Workshop held by ElectriCity at Lindholmen. Two thing got feedback on was that we needed statistics to show that people really wanted this app and which organization/company could actually want to invest in it. To help us answer these questions a survey was created. The link to it can be seen below. The survey was shared on out personal Facebook walls.

Might be worth noting that the program will not fetch the correct "next busstop" if the Innovation Platform is down.

The pure app is located at the Client branch, the pure server is also located at the Server branch.
